 # Building .deb files
 Take your source tarball, rename it to qview_#.#.orig.tar.gz and extract it to qview-#.#. Move the debian folder to the qview-#.# folder. Make sure to change the versions in control and changelog, the date on the changelog, the maintainer name if you happen to not be me.

 I just build the source deb and use the launchpad ppa binaries
